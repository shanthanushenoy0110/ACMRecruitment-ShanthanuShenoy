EXPLANATION TO THE PROBLEM

Here I have changed -99999 to float(“-inf”) which represents negative infinity so that if a value like -1000000 comes it may not skip it .
Second is I have added some if else constrains which will check the list contains no elements or contains only one element or all the elements are same.
Also I have added i !=largest constrain which will help  in finding out the second largest number as we are checking that the number is not bigger than the largest number.
